# Simulating-Self-Driving-Cabs

The Smart cab's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another location saving time by taking the shortest route while taking care of passenger’s safety and traffic rules.

There are different aspects that need to be considered here while modeling and Reinforcement Learning solution to this problem: rewards, states, and actions.

Users can book a cab by sending a free text SMS containing source, destination and time of travel. So text mining techniques are used to fetch pickup location, drop location and time of travel from text.

OpenAI Gym’s Taxi v3 environment, Text mining and Q-Learning algorithm were used.
